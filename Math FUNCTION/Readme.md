# The SUMIF function is a premade function in Excel, which calculates the sum of values in a range based on a true or false condition.

## It is typed =SUMIF:
## =SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])

## The condition is referred to as criteria, which can check things like:

If a number is greater than another number >
If a number is smaller than another number <
If a number or text is equal to something =
The [sum_range] is the range where the function calculates the sum.

**Note: The [sum_range] is optional.
If not specified, the function calculates the sum of the same range as the condition.**

## It is typed =SUMIFS:

## =SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2] ...)
The conditions are referred to as criteria1, criteria2, and so on, which can check things like:
If a number is greater than another number >
If a number is smaller than another number <
If a number or text is equal to something =
The criteria_range1, criteria_range2, and so on, are the ranges where the function check for the conditions.
The [sum_range] is the range where the function calculates the sum.

# Use wildcard characters. Using wildcard characters like the question mark (?) and asterisk (*) in criteria1,2 can help you find matches that are similar but not exact.
